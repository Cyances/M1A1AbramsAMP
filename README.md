# M1A1 Abrams AMP v1.0 (Initial release)
Big thanks to ATLAS/thebeninator for providing the Abrams and Bradley 50mm mod in the first place! All the required code was from his mods and I just figured out how to put the pieces together so that I could recreate the AMP round. Be sure to checkout both of those mods because they are great!

A mod for Gunner, HEAT, PC! Requires [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/)

If you get an error launching through Steam you will need to run the game executable directly.

Converts all M1IPs to M1A1s equipped with: 
	<ul>
	<li>120mm M256 Gun (44 rounds max) </li>
	<li>M829 APFSDS-T or M829A4 APFSD-T (20 rounds)</li>
    	<li>M830 HEAT-MP-T or XM1147 AMP-T (24 rounds, has shoulder fuze)</li>
 	</ul>
</p>

# How to use the XM1147 AMP-T:
<p>
	<ul> 
		<li>To use airburst mode, lase the target and aim slightly above ut so that the shell will not impact the target. The airburst fuzing is not perfect since it might explode in front or behind the target instead of somewhere in the middle, so multiple shots might be required. Or to help compensate for the deviation, increase the fragment count but this can impact game performance.</li>
		<li>To use point-detonate mode, make sure the range setting is at least 10 meters more than the target to ensure it would not be in airburst mode. As long as the shell directly hits the target, it will be in will use the point-detonate fuze.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

# Extra Features/Settings (in mod config):
<p>
	<ul> 
		<li>Convert non-IP M1s to M1E1s (enabled by default)</li>
		<li>Randomize M1A1/E1 conversions (enabled by default) </li>
 		<li>Horizontal sight stabilization for M1A1/E1s when applying lead (disabled by default)</li>
		<li>Use M829A4 instead of M829 (enabled by default)</li>
		<li>Use XM1147 instead of M830 (enabled by default)</li>
		<li>Customize the number of fragments generated by the XM1147 (600 by default). <b>Be careful when setting a higher number</b> because it can negatively affect game performance.</li>
		<li>Customize how many M829/A4 and M830/XM1147 rounds every M1A1/E1 carries.</li>
	</ul>
