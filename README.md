# M1A1 Abrams AMP v2.0
Big thanks to ATLAS/thebeninator for providing the Abrams and Bradley 50mm mod in the first place! All the required code was from his mods and I just figured out how to put the pieces together so that I could recreate the AMP round. Be sure to checkout both of those mods because they are great!

A mod for Gunner, HEAT, PC! Requires [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/)

If you get an error launching through Steam you will need to run the game executable directly.

<p>
	<ul> 
		<li>Armor testing done in game which can result in inconsistency between the area shot at, and the angle and distance from it. However, I did my best to shoot at less than 100 meters and as close to 0 degrees for the perpendicular shot to the armor face.</li>
		<li>The only exception is the turret cheek and hull front where I emulated a headon engagement.</li>
		<li>HA and HC armor figures are just a flat 12.5% and 25% increase in protection becaue finding proper documentation is difficult (please don't violate ITAR). However, the values can be changed in the future if required.</li>
		<li>HU armor figures are based on Steal Beasts</li>
	</ul>

## Round types list:
| Name  | Penetration (mm) | Muzzle Velocity (m/s) | Note |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| M829 APFSDS-T | 600  | 1670  | - |
| M829A1 APFSDS-T  | 700 | 1575 | - |
| M829A2 APFSDS-T | 800 | 1680 | - |
| M829A3 APFSDS-T | 900 | 1555 | - |
| M829A4 APFSDS-T | 1000 | 1700 | +50% spalling chance |
| M830 HEAT-MP-T | 600 | 1140 | - |
| M830A2 IHEAT-MP-T | 1200 | 1240 | +100% spalling chance |
| XM1147 AMP-T | 480 | 1410 | Airburst feature |

## How to use the XM1147 AMP-T:
<p>
	<ul> 
		<li>To use airburst mode, lase the target and aim slightly above it so that the shell will not impact the target. The airburst fuzing is not perfect since it might explode in front or behind the target instead of somewhere in the middle, so multiple shots might be required. Or to help compensate for the deviation, increase the fragment count but this can impact game performance.</li>
		<li>To use point-detonate mode, make sure the range setting is at least 10 meters more than the target to ensure it would not be in airburst mode. As long as the shell directly hits the target, it will use the point-detonate fuze.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

## Extra Features/Settings (in mod config):
<p>
	<ul> 
		<li>Selectable round types for three slots (a mix of M829A4, M830A2 and XM1147 by default). You can even go with a pure APFSDS or HEAT loadout. <b>Be careful typing the round you want</b> because the mod will default to vanilla rounds (M833/M456A2) if there is a typo or if a field is left blank.</li>
		<li>Customize how many rounds per type are carried by the M1A1/E1 (total max of 44).</li>
		<li>Customize the number of fragments generated by the XM1147 (600 by default). <b>Be careful when setting a higher number</b> because it can negatively affect game performance.</li>
 		<li>Horizontal sight stabilization for M1A1/E1s when applying lead (disabled by default)</li>
		<li>Convert non-IP M1s to M1E1s (enabled by default)</li>
		<li>Randomize M1A1/E1 conversions (enabled by default) </li>
		<li>Customize armor variant used by M1A1 and M1E1 (HU for both by default) </li>
	</ul>
</p>

## NOTE!
<p>
	<ul> 
		<li>Only include ATLAS' Abrams mod .dll file in the mods folder or this one. Do not place both .dll files at the same time.</li>
		<li>If you already have ATLAS' Abrams mod or have an older version of the Abramss AMP mod installed, either delete MelonPreferences.cfg in UserData folder or remove the lines pertaining to the [M1A1Config]/[M1A1AMPConfig] to make it easier to understand the custom config. Launch the game first then close it to update the contents of MelonPreferences.cfg</li>
	</ul>
