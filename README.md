### Engine
| Engine type  | Peak power (HP) | Peak Torque (NM) | Max RPM | Braking Power | Note |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| T64 | - | 12225 | 4300 | - |  | 
<p>
	<ul> 
		<li>Slight increased the T64 max RPM since it is redlining before the tank could reach its unrestricted top speed</li>
		<li>As a result, there is a slight reduction to max torque</li>
	</ul>
</p>


### Suspension
<p>
	<ul> 
		<li>Added upgradeable suspension which slightly increases ride height, and increases suspension travel that has better performance on rough terrain </li>
	</ul>
</p>


### Tracks
<p>
	<ul> 
		<li>Added upgradeable tracks which increases grip to aid acceleration, braking and movement on steep terrain</li>
	</ul>
</p>

## Other Features
### M1IP Model for M1E1
<p>
	<ul> 
		<li>Gives the M1IP model to the M1E1 (bustle rack)</li>
	</ul>
</p>

### Auxilliary Power Unit (APU)
<p>
	<ul> 
		<li>Even faster turret traversal speed (60°/s) but it only applies to T64 engine now and if it's still running</li>
	</ul>
</p>

### Smoke Launcher Upgrade
<p>
	<ul> 
		<li>Slightly reduced the throw distance of Smoke+ upgrade</li>
		<li>Added option for improved ROSY* that has a faster deployment time and greater smoke generation</li>
		<li>Added IR smoke option for ROSY*</li>
		<li>*Due to challenges in modding smoke grenades, the vanilla smoke grenade is directly modified which means the two options above will also affect the smoke grenade behavior of the M60A1/3, M2, M113 and unupgraded M1 smoke system.</li>
		<li>*FPS drops might occur from the enhanced smoked effects</li>
	</ul>
</p>

### More Crew Proficiency
<p>
	<ul> 
		<li>Commander and Gunner can have better (or worse) target spotting and gunnery skill</li>
