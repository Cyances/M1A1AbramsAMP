## Round Changes
| Name  | Penetration (mm) | Fragment/Spalling Penetration (mm)| Muzzle Velocity (m/s) | Note |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| M908 HE-OR-T | 250* | 75** | 1410 | New! Has impact-delay fuze |
| M830A1 HEAT-MP-T | - | 50** | 1410 | Has toggleable proximity fuze option in-game now |
| M830A2 IHEAT-FS-T | - | 35** | 1410 |  |
| M830A3 IHEAT-FS-T | - | 25** | 1310 |  |
| XM1147 AMP-T | 250* | 120** | - | Changed behavior to HE instead of HEAT. Has toggleable proximity fuze now but disabled in config. The time-delay fuze is still enabled by default. |
| M829 APFSDS-T | - | - | - | Toggleable +25% spalling chance |
| M829A1 APFSDS-T | - | - | - | Toggleable +25% spalling chance |
| M829A2 APFSDS-T | - | - | - | Toggleable +50% spalling chance |
| M829A3 APFSDS-T | - | - | - | Toggleable +75% spalling chance |
| M2/M8 AP-T/I | 29 | - | 887 | M2 Coax |
| M962 SLAP-T | 36 | - | 1200 | M2 Coax. Has slightly less drag than M2/M8. |

<p>
	<ul> 
		<li>*These are HE rounds so actual penetration is not 250mm</li>
		<li>**These are <i>up to</i> values so not every fragment will perform the same</li>
		<li>M830A1, XM1147, M908 have slightly less drag now</li>
	</ul>
</p>

## Other Features
### Enhanced optics
<p>
	<ul> 
		<li>GPS has 5 zoom levels (vs 2 for vanilla)</li>
