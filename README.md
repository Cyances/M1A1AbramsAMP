# M1A1 Abrams AMP v2.2

## Branch release notes:
<p>
	<ul> 
		<li>Code refactoring (same setup as Atlas' M1A1 Abrams v1.0.9)</li>
		<li>Revised round attributes (refer to table)</li>
		<li>Revised HU armor protection (refer to table)</li>
		<li>Added correct gunner auxilliary sight reticles per round type (however, this only applies to the first two rounds per tank)</li>
		<li>Added demigod armor in configuration if you really want an almost deathproof Abrooms (false by default and only applies to HU variant)</li>
		<li>NOTE: Mission loading might be longer if you are using the HU variant, potentially due to the extra armor configuration.</li>
		<li>NOTE: XM1111 is in the config file but it is not implemented yet. Listing that in your loadout will make the mod use vanilla loadout (M833/M456). I only included it so there is no need to manually cleanup the config file if I could make it work.</li>
	</ul>
